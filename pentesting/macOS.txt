Apple finally moved the notification center DB under "~/Library/Group Containers/group.com.apple.usernoted/db2/db" in macOS Sequoia.
So finally your Messages are being protected from being read through the notification center. (Only took like 4 years I think)
This is a one-liner to read the last notification (before Sequoia):

DA=`getconf DARWIN_USER_DIR`; sqlite3 $DA/com.apple.notificationcenter/db2/db "select hex(data) from record order by delivered_date desc limit 1;" | xxd -r -p - | plutil -p -
