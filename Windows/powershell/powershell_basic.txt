[Setting Up A Powershell Testing Environment]

[[Script Execution Policy]]
- Which determines what types of scripts PowerShell can execute. For example, we can check the current setting for the execution policy as follows:
PS C:\> Get-ExecutionPolicy
Restricted

- The restricted blocks all scripts from running unless they are signed with a trusted certificate. 
- As the scripts in this book are unsigned, we'll change the execution policy to RemoteSigned. This execution policy allows us to run unsigned PowerShell scripts if they're created locally but will not allow us to execute unsigned scripts downloaded in a web browser or attached to emails. 

- Run the following command to set the execution policy: 
PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
PS C:\> Get-ExecutionPolicy
RemoteSigned
- The above command changes the execution policy for the current user only, not the entire system. If you want to change it for all users, you'll need to start PowerShell as an administrator and then rerun the command, removing the Scope parameter. 
PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force

- If you're using the open source version of PowerShell or version 5.1 on Windows Server, then the default script execution policy is RemoteSigned and you donot have to change anything. Here are the commands to query PowerShell version 
PS C:\> GET-Host

Name             : ConsoleHost

- Now that we can run unsigned scripts, we can install the PowerShell module we'll be using for this book. 
- A PowerShell module is a package of scripts and .NET binaries that export PowerShell commands. Every installation of PowerShell comes preinstalled with several modules for tasks ranging from configuring your applications to setting up Windows Update. You can install a module manually by copying its files, but the easier approach is to use the PowerShell Gallery (https://www.powershellgallery.com), an online repository of modules.

[[Install A PowerShell Module]]
- To install a module from the PowerShell Gallery, we use PowerShell's Install-Module command. For this book, we'll need to install the NtObjectManager module, which we can do using the following command:

PS C:\> Install-Module NtObjectManager -Scope CurrentUser -Force

NuGet provider is required to continue
PowerShellGet requires NuGet provider version '2.8.5.201' or newer to interact with NuGet-based repositories. The
NuGet provider must be available in 'C:\Program Files (x86)\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies' or
'C:\<>\AppData\Local\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies'. You can also install the NuGet provider by
running 'Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -MinimumVersion 2.8.5.201 -Force'. Do you want PowerShellGet to install
and import the NuGet provider now?
[Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"):

Press "Y".

- If you have the module installed already, you can ensure that you have the latest version by using the Update-Module commands:

PS C:\> Update-Module NtObjectManager

- Once it's installed, you can load the module using the Import-Module command:

PS C:\> Import-Module NtObjectManager
PS C:\> New-NtObjectDescriptor
New-NtObjectDescriptor : The term 'New-NtObjectDescriptor' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function,
script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is
correct and try again.
