================================================================================================
Core architectural difference between Linux and Windows:
  - Linux is a file-oriented operating system,while Windows is API oriented 
  - Though APIs can provide a much richer set of capabilities, they come at the expense of simplicity 
  - So, exploring an API oriented operating system is more difficult. You need to read the API documentation, write code, compile and run it, 
    and debug the results.
