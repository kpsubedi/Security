Intro to Injection Attacks (IA)
===============================
- IA is one of the most common vulnerabilities and listed in OWASP Top 10 since its first release in 2003. 
- Some injection vulnerabilities are reasonably well known, for instance, SQL Injection, Command Injection, or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), 
there are significantly more injection vulnerabilities, most of which are less well known. 
- The more famous types of injection vulnerabilities are certainly more common, however, on the other hand, most 
developers are aware of them, and common web application frameworks by-default prevent them effecctively. 
Since there is less awareness of the less common injection vulnerabilites, defense mechanisms are often implemented incorrectly or not at all, 
leading to simple attack vectors that can be exploited without any need for security control bypasses or advanced exploitation techniques. 

Injection Attacks
-----------------
* XPath Injection: XML Path Language (XPath) is a query language for Extensible Markup Language (XML) data, similar to how SQL is a query language for 
databases. As such, XPath is used to query data from XML documents. Web applications that need to retrieve data stored in an XML format 
thus rely on XPath to retrieve the required data. XPath Injection vulnerabilities arise when user input is inserted into XPath queries without 
proper sanitization. Like SQLi vulnerabilities, XPath injection can risk the entire data as successfully exploiting XPath injection 
allows an attacker to retrieve the entire XML document. 

* LDAP Injection: Lightweight Diretory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a protocol used to access directory server such as Active Directory (AD). 
Web applications often use LDAP queries to enable integration with AD services. For instance, LDAP can enable AD users to authenticate to 
the web application. LDAP injection vulnerabilities arise when user input is inserted into serarch filters without proper sanitization. 
This can lead to authentication bypasses if LDAP authentication is incorrectly implemented. Additionally, LDAP injection can lead to
loss of data.
