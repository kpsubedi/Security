- IA is one of the most common vulnerabilities and listed in OWASP Top 10 since its first release in 2003. 
- Some injection vulnerabilities are reasonably well known, for instance, SQL Injection, Command Injection, or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), 
there are significantly more injection vulnerabilities, most of which are less well known.
